About this submission:
 - I used one slip day.
 - My program only scans singly indirect blocks. I don't have time to write it to scan 2x and 3x indirect blocks, but if lab3b 
   is dependent on this, then I will fix it.
 - I'm not entirely sure if my strategy for scanning directory entries is correct, but it works on the trivial example.
   - this is probably the only place where the docs are unclear. I figured it wasn't safe to assume a dirent with a 0 inode meant
	 	 that it is the last dirent, although that is the case in the example. Instead, I tried to scan the entire block, but assumed
		 that the directory entries linkedlist wouldn't span multiple blocks, which I'm not sure is a safe assumption.
